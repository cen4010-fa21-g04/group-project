          My name is Brian Rudowitz, I am a senior here at FAU majoring in
          Computer Science. I began my studies at Palm Beach State College and
          transfered here when I got my Associates degree.<br></br> I am
          currently 31 years old and work a full-time job in the medical sales
          field. However, as we get closer to selling our company I am looking
          forward to a life afterwards where I can use my technical knowledge to
          improve the world!<br></br>

            <b>Education</b>
          </h3>
          <p>
            My schooling began in Baltimore, Maryland in 2009. I quickly learned
            that I was in no way ready for school and decided to not waste any
            more money and left school to travel and explore the world. I did
            that for the next 3 years until I was ready to move forward and
            settle down in South Florida. I am now close to completing my long,
            unusual journey through school and I couldnt be more excited!

            <b>Employment</b>
          </h3>
          <p>
            My work history is rather extensive as I have beena full-time
            employee for alomst 10 years now. I began with cooking in various
            restaurants throughout my 20s. I started in a Chinese food
            restaurant, moved onto an Italian restuarant and eventually ended up
            running a high end steakhouse in Pompano Beach. All of this came to
            and end in 2016 when I begin the journey of joining the medical
            device field with my two good friends. We have now been growing the
            company for almost 7 years and have learned valuable management and
            work experienve along the way that I can apply to any job.

          <p>
            When I am not working or doing school work, I still have a strong
            desire to travel. I love experiencing new cultures and new foods and
            getting out of my comfort zone. I also enjoy working out, and
            staying active with sports such as basketball and golf.
